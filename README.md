# CardioGood Fitness---EDA
The market research team at AdRight is assigned the task to identify the profile of the typical customer for each treadmill product offered by CardioGood Fitness. The market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics. The team decides to collect data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at a CardioGoodFitness retail store during the prior three months. The data are stored in the CardioGoodFitness.csv file. The team identifies the following customer variables to study: product purchased, TM195, TM498, or TM798; gender; age, in years;education, in years; relationship status, single or partnered; annual household income ($); average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week; average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week; and self-rated fitness on an 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is poor shape and 5 is excellent shape.

# Business Recommendations and Insights
* TM195 & TM498 attracts people with income less than 60k , may be because of cost of both models. We should market these models as a budget Treadmill for all.
* TM798 should be marketed as a high end Treadmill for professionals and athletes. Create a luxiurous brand image for this Treadmill.
* Assuming TM 798 provides high margin of profit, we should brand it as Treadmill for athletes. We can also endorse some athlete to promote this Treadmill. This might increase there sales.
* Considering above observations, We can attract customers to upgrade from their existing treadmill and switch to TM798 ,highlighting extra features this Treadmill provides.
* To expand our sales with Female customers, We could run a marketing campaign during Women's days, Mothers days emphasizing on fitness and exercise.
* The age of our customers are in the range of 35 years old and 18 years old. We need to research if there is any scope to increase sale with customers who are more than 35 years old.
